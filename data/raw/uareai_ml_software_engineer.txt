Company
Uare.ai, founded by Robert LoCascio (former CEO of LivePerson), is an AI startup launched in May 2024 with a mission to empower people to do more with their memories. Uare.ai creates AI-driven personal digital twins, enabling users to preserve, share, and interact with their knowledge and stories.

At its core is the proprietary Human Life Model (HLM), designed to process unstructured conversation and story data without training client data directly into traditional LLMs. Uare.ai leverages third-party LLMs for conversations while HLM provides structure and reasoning. The platform has broad B2C and B2B applications, and has been featured in outlets like NBC, NPR, The New York Post, and CNET.
