AI / Machine Learning Engineer
Citizen Health

Who We Are
Citizen Health was founded on the belief that having the right advocate is the single most important factor in achieving better care and outcomes. By combining data, AI, and community, Citizen is building a personalized AI advocate powered by patients' complete medical histories and data from thousands of other patients. Starting in rare and complex conditions, patients share their data in exchange for value, enabling biopharma and researchers with seamless access to patients and regulatory-grade data, accelerating drug development.

The Role
Citizen Health is seeking AI/Machine Learning Engineers to lead the development and deployment of cutting-edge AI solutions that power our patient-centric platform. This role is crucial in designing and implementing sophisticated machine learning models that transform complex health data into actionable insights for patients, healthcare providers, and researchers.

Responsibilities
- Design and implement end-to-end machine learning solutions, from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring.
- Develop and optimize agentic Large Language Model (LLM) solutions for healthcare applications using techniques like fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Create robust data pipelines for validation and deployment.
- Implement ML systems that can process and analyze diverse healthcare data types, including structured clinical data, medical imaging, and unstructured text.
- Collaborate with backend engineers to integrate ML models into production infrastructure.
- Ensure ML systems meet strict healthcare compliance requirements while maintaining high performance.
- Design and implement monitoring systems for model performance, data drift, and system health.
- Lead research initiatives to explore and implement state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques.
- Collaborate with clinical experts to validate model outputs and ensure medical accuracy.
- Stay current with the latest developments in AI/ML, particularly in healthcare applications.
