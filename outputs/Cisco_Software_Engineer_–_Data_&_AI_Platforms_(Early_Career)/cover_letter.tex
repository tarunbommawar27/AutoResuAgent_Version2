% Opening
Dear Cisco Hiring Team,

% Body
I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer – Data \& AI Platforms (Early Career) position at Cisco. Your commitment to harnessing data and AI to transform the future of technology resonates deeply with my passion for developing innovative solutions that drive efficiency and insight.

During my recent internship as a Full Stack Developer at IntelliCloud Apps, I designed and implemented scalable data pipelines using Hadoop, which significantly reduced manual intervention by 50\%. This experience not only honed my technical skills in building robust data infrastructures but also aligned perfectly with your requirement for maintaining scalable analytics services that support AI/ML workloads. Additionally, my work optimizing CI/CD pipelines via Jenkins improved deployment efficiency by 30\%, ensuring seamless application rollouts across multi-cloud environments. This directly relates to the infrastructure-building aspect of your role, where integrating machine learning capabilities into production systems is critical.

I am particularly drawn to Cisco’s collaborative culture, as I believe that working with cross-functional teams is essential for integrating data and machine learning functionalities effectively. My background in collaborating on RESTful API integrations has prepared me to contribute to your team and enhance data-driven application performance. I am eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm for AI to Cisco, contributing to your innovative projects.

I would love the opportunity to discuss how my experiences and skills align with the goals of Cisco. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

% Closing
Sincerely,
Tarun Bommawar
