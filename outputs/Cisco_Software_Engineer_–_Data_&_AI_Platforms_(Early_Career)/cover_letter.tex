% Opening
Dear Hiring Manager,

% Body
I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer – Data \& AI Platforms position at Cisco. With a strong foundation in data engineering and a passion for developing scalable solutions, I am eager to contribute to a pioneering company that is at the forefront of innovation in AI and machine learning.

During my recent internship as a Full Stack Developer at IntelliCloud Apps, I designed and maintained scalable data processing pipelines using Hadoop and Hive, which significantly enhanced automation and reduced manual effort by 50\%. This experience not only honed my skills in building and optimizing data infrastructure but also deepened my understanding of the complexities involved in supporting AI/ML workloads. Additionally, I successfully optimized machine learning model training by leveraging GPU acceleration, resulting in a 40\% reduction in training latency. My collaborative work in Agile teams allowed me to integrate machine learning capabilities into production systems effectively, directly aligning with Cisco's goal of enhancing system efficiency through innovative data solutions.

I am particularly drawn to Cisco’s commitment to creating intelligent networks and its focus on leveraging data for transformative solutions. The opportunity to collaborate with diverse cross-functional teams to integrate advanced data and ML capabilities resonates with my professional aspirations. I am eager to bring my technical skills in Python, SQL, and cloud infrastructures to your team, contributing to Cisco’s mission of driving digital transformation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and enthusiasms align with the innovative projects at Cisco.

Sincerely,
Tarun Bommawar
