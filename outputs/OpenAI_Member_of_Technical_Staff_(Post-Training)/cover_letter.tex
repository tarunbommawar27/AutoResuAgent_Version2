% Opening
I am excited to apply for the Member of Technical Staff (Post-Training) position at OpenAI. The opportunity to contribute to the development of cutting-edge models that enhance reasoning and instruction following aligns perfectly with my passion for advancing artificial intelligence and my technical expertise.

% Body
During my recent internship as a Full Stack Developer at IntelliCloud Apps, I developed reinforcement learning algorithms using Python and PyTorch, which improved model instruction following by 20\%. This experience not only honed my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of model training dynamics. Additionally, while scaling reinforcement learning pipelines across over 1000 GPUs, I achieved a 30\% increase in training efficiency and model performance. This technical challenge has prepared me to tackle the demands of scaling sophisticated systems as outlined in your job description.

Furthermore, my role involved designing automated evaluation harnesses that measured model alignment and accuracy. By implementing this solution in Python, I successfully reduced manual assessment time by 70\%, which I believe is essential for ensuring the safety and factual accuracy of models at OpenAI. I am genuinely impressed by OpenAI's commitment to safety and ethical AI, and I am eager to contribute to these crucial areas while collaborating with a team of innovative thinkers.

% Closing
I would love the opportunity to discuss how my background in reinforcement learning and distributed systems can contribute to the exciting work at OpenAI. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to the possibility of discussing this role further.
