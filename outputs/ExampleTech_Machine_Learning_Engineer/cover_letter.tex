% Opening
Dear ExampleTech Hiring Team,

% Body
I am excited to apply for the Machine Learning Engineer position at ExampleTech. With a solid foundation in developing machine learning pipelines and a strong passion for natural language processing (NLP), I am eager to contribute to your innovative team and help drive the next wave of advancements in technology.

During my recent internship at AnalyticsCo, I developed NLP pipelines using Python that successfully classified over 10,000 customer support tickets, increasing classification accuracy by 15\%. This experience honed my skills in building and maintaining machine learning models tailored for real-world applications. Additionally, while collaborating with data scientists at AnalyticsCo, I played a key role in deploying models to production, leading to a 20\% improvement in response times. My commitment to writing clean and maintainable Python code, as well as crafting efficient SQL queries, significantly reduced model performance monitoring time by 30\%, demonstrating my ability to contribute effectively to team goals.

I am particularly drawn to ExampleTech's focus on leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance user experiences. I believe my background in machine learning and my collaborative spirit align perfectly with your team’s objectives. I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to the exciting projects at ExampleTech.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity with you.
