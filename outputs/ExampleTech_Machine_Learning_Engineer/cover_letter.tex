% Opening
Dear ExampleTech Hiring Team,

% Body
I am excited to apply for the Machine Learning Engineer position at ExampleTech. With a passion for natural language processing and a solid foundation in Python and machine learning, I am eager to contribute to your team and help drive innovative solutions in NLP use cases.

In my recent role as a Data Science Intern at AnalyticsCo, I successfully built and maintained NLP pipelines that enhanced customer support ticket classification accuracy by 30\%. This experience not only honed my technical skills in Python but also allowed me to collaborate closely with data scientists to deploy models into production—an effort that reduced our deployment time by 25\%. Furthermore, my ability to write clean, maintainable SQL queries has been vital in monitoring model performance, resulting in a 20\% decrease in troubleshooting time. These experiences align well with the responsibilities outlined in your job description and demonstrate my ability to deliver impactful results.

I admire ExampleTech’s commitment to leveraging machine learning for real-world applications, and I am particularly drawn to the collaborative environment you foster. I believe that my background in developing REST APIs and optimizing data integration processes would be a valuable addition to your team. I am eager to bring my technical expertise and collaborative spirit to ExampleTech and contribute to your ongoing success.

Thank you for considering my application. I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of ExampleTech. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your innovative projects.

% Closing
Sincerely,
Tarun Bommawar
