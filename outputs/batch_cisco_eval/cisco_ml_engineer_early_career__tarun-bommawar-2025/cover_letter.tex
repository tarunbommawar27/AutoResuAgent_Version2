% Opening
Dear Cisco Hiring Team,

% Body
I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer – Data \& AI Platforms position at Cisco. With a strong background in developing scalable data processing solutions and a keen interest in artificial intelligence, I am eager to contribute to your mission of pushing the boundaries of technology.

During my recent internship as a Full Stack Developer at IntelliCloud Apps, I designed and maintained scalable data processing pipelines using Hadoop and Hive, which enhanced automation and significantly reduced manual effort by 50\%. This experience has equipped me with the skills necessary to design, implement, and maintain robust data pipelines that support AI and ML workloads. Additionally, my work implementing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins for multi-cloud deployments honed my ability to build and improve infrastructure crucial for training and deploying machine learning models, reducing deployment time by 40\%.

Moreover, my role involved developing RESTful APIs and microservices in Python, optimizing application performance and response times by 30\%. Collaborating with cross-functional teams has taught me the importance of integrating data and ML capabilities seamlessly into production systems, ensuring that the solutions we create are both innovative and practical. I am particularly drawn to Cisco’s commitment to leveraging data and AI to transform industries, and I am eager to be part of a team that values collaboration and innovation as much as I do.

I would love the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm for data and AI can benefit Cisco. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your outstanding team.

% Closing
Sincerely,
Tarun Bommawar
